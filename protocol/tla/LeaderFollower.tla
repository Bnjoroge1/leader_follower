**Key Corrections and Simplifications:**

1.  **State Variables**: Added `leader_known`, `last_heard_from`, `last_leader_ping` to manage leader knowledge and basic timeout concepts. `status` now includes `CANDIDATE` and `DOWN`.
2.  **Leader Election**: `CandidateClaimsLeadership` is simplified (lowest ID claims first). `HandleClaimLeader` now correctly compares IDs.
3.  **Check-ins**: Actions added for leader sending check-ins, followers responding, and leader processing responses, including updating basic counters (`last_heard_from`, `last_leader_ping`).
4.  **Timeouts**: Placeholder actions `LeaderDetectsTimeout` and `FollowerDetectsTimeout` are included but need a proper model of time (e.g., using a `now` variable incremented by a `Tick` action) for accurate verification. The `CurrentTime - TimeoutValue` is a placeholder.
5.  **Properties**: `LeaderIsLowestActive` attempts to capture the lowest ID requirement. `EventuallyHaveLeader` checks for eventual leader election among active devices.
6.  **Fairness**: `WF_vars(Next)` is crucial for checking liveness properties.

**To Run:** Use the TLA+ Toolbox as described previously, but open `LeaderFollower_Corrected.tla` and use `LeaderFollower_Corrected.cfg` (or configure the model manually based on the `.cfg` content).

**Note:** This is still a simplified model. A full verification would require:
*   A proper model of time for timeouts.
*   More detailed handling of message loss or reordering if needed.
*   Modeling task assignment if those properties are critical.
*   Refining the conditions under which devices become `CANDIDATE` or `DOWN`.// filepath: LeaderFollower_Corrected.tla
